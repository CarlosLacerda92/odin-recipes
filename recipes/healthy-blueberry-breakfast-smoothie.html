            Description

        <p>
            A quick recipe I thought up while trying to decide what to eat for breakfast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Great if you are trying to figure out what to do with those blueberries in the fridge or freezer! Also great on-the-go! Delicious and includes many foods that are a great way to start your day! Many of the ingredients, except for the blueberries and yogurt, are optional and vary depending on your own taste. I love cinnamon and a thick, super-cold smoothie.
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe is super versatile, and you can change it depending on dietary needs or personal preference.

            Have fun with it!
