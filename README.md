# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes | The Odin Project

This project consists of a page with links to some recipes. Each one of those links redirects the user to a page where the information of the clicked recipe is located.

Here, the main goal was to put into practice what was learned in all lessons until now. This include:

- Navigating through files and directories using the command line;
- Creating files and directories, also using the command line;
- The HTML boilerplate;
- Working with texts (paragraphs and headings);
- Working with lists (ordered and unordered);
- Working with links and images;
- Using git along with Github to store the project.
